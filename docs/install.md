Installing FIDOk
================

FIDOk isn't yet released. To "install" it, you need to first build it:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

This will place the library in different forms in `library/build/`. Find the one appropriate for
your use case.

This documentation will improve as FIDOk matures.
