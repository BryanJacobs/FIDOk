This directory contains license files for third-party software that is
(in at least some situations) redistributed with binaries produced from this
repository.

By and large, the terms involved are BSD-3-clause/MIT or Apache licenses and similar
permissive licenses.

In some cases, binaries from these projects may be distributed in this repository itself;
where that is the case, it is done so as permitted by the terms of the corresponding license.

None of the licenses in this directory are copyright terms relating to the uncompiled source
code in this repository. That code is itself under the terms of the `LICENSE` file located
in the repository root.
